## Usage

### Solve Daily Wordle
To solve the daily Wordle puzzle:

```bash
python wordle_auto.py daily
```

```bash
python wordle_auto.py --size 8 daily
```

### Solve Random Wordle
To solve a random Wordle puzzle:
```bash

```

### Solve a Specific Word
To solve a specific Wordle word (e.g., "apple"):
```bash
python wordle_auto.py --size 5 word apple
```

### Arguments
- `--size`: The size of the Wordle puzzle (e.g., `5` for a 5-letter Wordle). The default value is 5
- `daily`: Solve the daily Wordle.
- `random`: Solve a random Wordle.
- `word`: Solve a specific Wordle word (requires an additional argument for the word). If the number of alphabets in the specified word is not 5, you must specify the size accordingly.

## How It Works

The solver uses a combination of feedback from the Wordle API and a heuristic algorithm to generate guesses. It keeps track of:
- **Correct letters**: Letters that are in the correct position.
- **Present letters**: Letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.
- **Absent letters**: Letters that are not in the word.

Based on this information, the solver generates the next guess until the word is solved or the maximum number of attempts is reached.

## Limitations
- The solver relies on the Wordle API (`https://wordle.votee.dev:8000/`) for feedback. If the API is unavailable, the solver will not work.
- The solver may not always find the correct word within the maximum number of attempts (100 by default).
